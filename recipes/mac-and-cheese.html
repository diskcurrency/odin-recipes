        <li>3 cups milk
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard

    <ol>
        <li>So, you want to make mac and cheese? Wow, impressive, I never would've thought of that.</li>
        <li>First, cook the macaroni according to the package directions. I mean, come on, you can't even make pasta
            without a set of instructions?</li>
        <li>Next, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Watch out, don't burn the whole place down.</li>
        <li>Add flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture turns light brown. Congratulations, you can cook a
            roux. Maybe one day you'll be able to make something more complex than mac and cheese.</li>
        <li>Whisk in milk and cook for 5-7 minutes until it thickens. I hope you're using a whisk and not just a fork
            like some kind of caveman.</li>
        <li>Add some mustard, salt, and pepper to taste. Wow, you're really going wild with the seasonings there.</li>
        <li>Continue whisking until the mixture thickens. Because, you know, we wouldn't want any runny mac and cheese
            now, would we?</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the cheddar and Parmesan cheeses. If you haven't already eaten all the cheese
            straight from the package, that is.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir to combine. And voila, you've made mac and cheese. I
            hope you're proud of yourself.</li>
    </ol>
