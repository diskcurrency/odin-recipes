    <h3>Impress Your friends with this pretentious recipe.</h3>

    <p>Oh, look who's trying to impress their guests with a fancy Swiss dish. We see you. Well, if you must know, our
        indulgent and creamy cheese fondue recipe is made with melted cheese, white wine, lemon juice, and a touch of
        garlic. Because apparently just plain melted cheese isn't good enough for you. And of course, you'll need to dip
        something into it, because it's not like you can just eat cheese with a spoon like a normal person. But hey, we
        get it. You're trying to be sophisticated. Just don't forget to swirl and savor every bite, because otherwise,
        what's the point?
    </p>

    <h4 class="recipe-lists">Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 lb grated cheese (such as cheddar, Swiss, or a combination)</li>
        <li>1 cup white wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Bread, vegetables, or fruit for dipping</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="recipe-lists">Steps:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Take a moment to appreciate the aroma of garlic as you cut a clove in half and rub it over the inside of a
            fondue pot or a saucepan. Oh, wait, you're not a food critic? Just do it and throw the garlic away.
        </li>
        <li>Get ready to get your hands dirty as you toss the grated cheese with cornstarch in a bowl. No, seriously,
            get ready.</li>
        <li>Pour some wine into the pot and heat it up over medium heat until it begins to simmer. Don't worry if it
            takes a while, you have nothing better to do anyway.</li>
        <li>Time to channel your inner professional chef and gradually add the cheese to the wine while stirring
            constantly until it's melted and smooth. If you mess this up, you'll have to start over, so no pressure!
        </li>
        <li>As if it wasn't cheesy enough already, stir in some lemon juice and add salt and pepper to taste. Hopefully,
            you don't overdo it and ruin the whole thing.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pot to a stand over a flame or keep it on the stove over low heat, and don't forget to take a
            picture for Instagram.</li>
        <li>Serve with bread, vegetables, or fruit for dipping, if you happen to have any in your pantry that is. Don't
            worry, we won't judge you if you end up dipping your old socks in there instead.</li>
    </ol>
