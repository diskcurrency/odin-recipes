    <h1>Grilled Cheese Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/grilled-cheese-cartoon.png" alt="grilled-cheese-sandwich">

    <h3>Apparently some people need instructions for this.</h3>

    <p>Ah, the classic grilled cheese sandwich. A go-to for those who just can't handle life's complexities. Made with
        a mere three ingredients – bread, cheese, and butter – this sandwich is perfect for the lazy and uninspired. But
        hey, who needs inspiration when you have a grilled cheese, am I right? Whether you're too lazy to cook a real
        meal or just want to relive your childhood memories, the grilled cheese is here to save the day. And with a
        variety of cheeses and breads to choose from, you can mix and match to your heart's content. So go ahead,
        indulge in your mediocrity. We won't judge.

    <h4 class="recipe-lists">Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread of your choice</li>
        <li>2 slices of cheese of your choice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>

    </ul>

    <h4 class="recipe-lists">Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your non-stick pan because this is about to get wild.</li>
        <li>Spread some butter on bread, because we all know you have some white bread and butter in your fridge.</li>
        <li>Slap that bread, buttered side down, onto the pan. You're basically a gourmet chef now.</li>
        <li>Put some cheese on top of the bread, because obviously that's what makes a grilled cheese a grilled cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Stick the other slice of bread on top, buttered side facing up, because who needs to count calories anyway?
        </li>
        <li>Cook until the bread is golden brown, or until you get distracted by a cat video on your phone and burn it.
        </li>
        <li>Flip it over and cook until the other side is golden brown and the cheese is melted, or until you
            accidentally set off your smoke alarm.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and pretend you're a master chef, even though you just made a grilled cheese.</li>
    </ol>
